# getdata-project

This project contains 3 files (excluding this README) that complete the programming assignment for the
Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The files are:

**run_analysis.R** A self-contained script that will download the original data, perform the cleaning, and output
the resulting "tidy" data.

**CodeBook.md** A description of the resulting "tidy" data.

**summary_means.txt** The "tidy" data as described in the programming assignment.
